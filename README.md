    Artemis Financial was the client for this project, and they required a vulnerability assessment for their
financial management software. Specifically, they needed assistance identifying and addressing any security
vulnerabilities in their software to ensure it was secure and functional. We successfully found vulnerabilities
in the software by conducting a thorough security assessment and using a range of testing methodologies.
It is important to code securely as software security helps protect a company's data and systems from
potential unauthorized access or also malicious attacks, and other security risks. This will in turn add value
to the company's overall well-being by reducing the risk of a security breach and reputational damage. One of the most
challenging parts of the vulnerability assessment was identifying and addressing complex vulnerabilities that
required extensive testing and analysis. We increased layers of security by implementing secure coding practices,
using encryption, and strengthening access controls. In the future, we would use automated security testing
tools and techniques to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use. After refactoring
the code, we checked for new vulnerabilities by conducting further security testing and validation. We used
a range of resources and tools and coding practices which includes code reviews, and secure coding guidelines
which would be helpful in future assignments or tasks.
